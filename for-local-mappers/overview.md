If you're a local mapper, or running a local mapping project, then the Overpass API and
Overpass Turbo can be helpful in allowing you to do things like:

* find and correct simple errors in tagging
* identify areas that may need to be resurveyed
* visualise progress of a community mapping activity, e.g. to capture details about wheelchair access
* extract useful sets of data to use in JOSM or other mapping tools

This collection of queries is intended to collect together useful queries to support
these types of use case.

The API and tools aren't a substitute for directly meeting and coordinating as a community.
And there are a variety of other tools, services and forums to help to monitor recent changesets or
discuss projects. But a well crafted query might help guide some of that work.

Feel free to [contribute any new queries](../contribute.html) or suggest queries
for inclusion in the [discussion forum on github](https://github.com/ldodds/osm-queries/discussions).
