# Colophon

This website was developed by [Leigh Dodds](http://ldodds.com).

It was generated using an open source tool called [overpass-doc](https://github.com/ldodds/overpass-doc)
which is designed to support the publication of collections of OverpassQL queries. It provides a
simple command-line interface for generating documentation from packages of Overpass queries.

The [source files are all in github](https://github.com/ldodds/osm-queries) and are in the public domain.

It relies on [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) and
[CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/).

The syntax highlighting code was adapted from the [Overpass Turbo code](https://github.com/tyrasd/overpass-turbo)
which is published under an MIT Licence.

The site is hosted and served from [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), with
a [Lets Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificate.
