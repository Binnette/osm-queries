There are a variety of languages for applying declarative styling to maps.

[MapCSS](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/MapCSS) is a CSS style language that
is supported in a number of different OSM editors and applications.

Overpass Turbo supports styling of query results using MapCSS. While it has
[some restrictions on the supported features](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_turbo/MapCSS)
it can still be a useful way to quickly generate interactive maps directly from the
IDE.

With that in mind, this collection of queries demonstrates some of the MapCSS
syntax.

It includes a mixture of basic examples, as well as some more creative uses.
