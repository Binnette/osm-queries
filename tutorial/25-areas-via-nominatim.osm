/*
This query shows another way to find areas to help filter queries.

OverpassTurbo provides several extensions to the core OverpassQL language. We
met one of those much earlier in the tutorial, where we used `{{bbox}}` to
automatically define a bounding box based on the current view of the map in the
IDE.

Another useful extension is `geocodeArea`, which is demonstrated in this query.

The extension accepts a search parameter which is used to do a Nominatim free-text
search to find the first matching area.

This can be a more flexible way to match areas. Otherwise we are limited to doing
matching of tag values using regular expressions.

Just remember this is an Overpass Turbo only feature.
