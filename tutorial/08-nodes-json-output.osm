/*
By default the Overpass API returns XML results.

When you're viewing results in the Overpass Turbo application by default it'll show your results on
a map. (Assuming you have used an `out` option that includes geometry). You can always see the
raw data by clicking on the "Data" tab in the UI.

The API can also produce JSON output. To request that you need to use the `out`
query setting. Confusingly this has the same name as the keyword used to generate
results in different level of details, but they perform different roles.

* `[out:xxx]` is a query setting that specifies the format of the data
* `out` is a statement that is used to control how much data is included in the results

Unfortunately the output isn't geojson. Its a custom JSON output format.

Its not hard to convert this to GeoJSON if you need it. If you're using the Overpass Turbo
application then the "Export" menu offers the option to do this conversion for you. This is
downloaded directly from the application. You can't request GeoJSON directly from the API.
