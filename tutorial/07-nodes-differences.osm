/*
The previous example demonstrated how to create the union of multiple queries.

The general syntax was:

```
( statement1; statement2; )
```

We can also calculate the difference between two sets of results. We do
this by using the minus operator. The general syntax is:

```
( statement1; - statement2; )
```

Where the result will be those nodes (or ways or relations) returned by
`statement1` that weren't returned by `statement2`

The query below illustrates how to use this by finding all nodes that are
tagged as tourist areas and are not tagged as caves.

We can achieve the same thing using simple tag filters, but this helps to
illustrate the basic syntax.
