/*
Filters applied to queries for nodes, ways and relations can be combined to
build up more complex expressions.

In this example we combine a key-value match with a regular expression to
match nodes that are tagged as cave entrances and whose name starts with
"Kulpi" in Pitjantjatjara.

The comments show a variation that illustrates querying for nodes that
have a name but don't have a name in Pitjantjatjara

Any number of filters can be appended to the `node` keyword (or other ways to
extract data, like `way`). All will need to be true for a node to be included
in the results.
