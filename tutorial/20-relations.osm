/*
Having looked at nodes and ways, the final part of the data model to explore
are relations.

Relations are collections of nodes and ways. They describe logical groupings of
objects that go beyond their basic spatial relationship. For example a relation
can be used to describe:

* a bus route, which connects a set of bus stop (nodes) and ways (the route)
* an administrative boundary
* a multipolygon, such as a collection of buildings that represent a single location

We query for relations using the `relation` keyword. We can filter them using
their tags and use the recurse down operators to find their contents.

The following query finds administrative boundaries that relate to our bounding
box.
