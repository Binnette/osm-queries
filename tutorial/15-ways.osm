/*
Ways are used to describe lines and polygons in the OpenStreetMap database.

Ways are used for roads, paths and the boundaries of buildings and parks.

To query for ways we just use the `way` keyword instead of the `node` keyword.

For example, the following query extracts all the ways in our bounding box.

When you run this query it will return the data about those ways. This includes
their tags and references to the individual nodes that describe them.

When you run this query, Overpass Turbo won't be able to generate a map for you.
It will probably give you a warning about that. This is because ways don't have
their own geometry. Instead they are associated with a collection of nodes that
mark out the line or polygon we might draw on a map.

In Overpass Turbo you can view the tags for these ways and the ids of the
nodes that describe them in the "Data" tab.
