/*
OverpassQL allows us to perform some basic spatial queries.

We've already explored various ways to query for nodes within a bounding box.

We can also search for nodes or other features that can be found within a circular
around using the `around` filter.

The simplest form of this filter accepts a distance (in meters) and a latitude and
longitude. This point and distance describe the centre of a circle and its radius.

The query then filters elements to just those who location is within that circle.

The example below finds nodes tagged as caves that are within 800m of the peak
of Uluru. There is a single result, which is a cave called Tjilpi Pampa Kulpi.

Notice that we don't define a bounding box for this particular query. Our area
of interest is specified by the `around` filter.

There are more complex ways that we can use the `around` filter.

Instead of searching within a circle, we can instead query for
nodes that can be found near to a line. To use this variant, you need to specify
multiple latitude/longitude pairs that describe the line you want to draw on the map.

An even more useful version of `around` is shown in the next example.
