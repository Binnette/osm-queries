This collection of queries provides a simple tutorial that covers the key features
of Overpass QL.

Each query focuses on a specific feature of the language. Each feature is
introduced and then you are encouraged to read, run and customise the query to
learn how to adapt it.

Each query includes comments that explains the basic syntax of the query and
how it works.

In some cases, comments are marked as "`TRYME`". These indicate sections of the
query that you can customise to explore more of the functionality. Instructions
are given in each example.

**Note**: Overpass Turbo remembers which area of OpenStreetMap you were last looking at.
This means that sometimes after a query is loaded and run in the editor, you might be
looking at the wrong location. Use the "Zoom to Data" option (the magnifying glass) to
recentre on your results.
