/*
Now that we can query for both nodes and ways we can do more complex queries.

Here's is an example that finds ways within our bounding box, then uses an
`around` query to find nodes tagged as amenities that are within 100 meters.

Remember that the `around` filter will read from the default set if no other
options are specified. So here our search is just limited to the ways within
our bounding box.
